# Churn_Modelling_bank
The challenge is to investigate the high customer churn rate at a bank and provide insights to address the problem. This will involve analyzing a dataset to understand the reasons for the high churn rate and presenting recommendations to address the issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Churn modeling using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn, or the likelihood that a customer will stop doing business with a company. The goal of churn modeling is to identify customers who are at risk of leaving, so that the company can take action to prevent them from leaving.

<p>You can run a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab, which is a free cloud-based platform for running Jupyter notebooks. Here's how you can do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Google Colab: Visit <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">https://colab.research.google.com/</a> to access Google Colab.</li>

  <li>Upload ANN.ipynb file there and select "Python 3".</li>

  <li>Run the code: You can run the code in a Jupyter cell by clicking on the "play" button or by pressing "Shift+Enter".</li>
  
  <li>Upload the "churn_modelling.csv" file when you run the first block</li>
  
  <li>Run each block step bby step</li>
</ol>
